D&D Above is the ultimate D&D Character Builder and Character Sheet. Create, build and play your D&D characters anywhere, anytime.

## Getting started

To get started run `git clone ggit@github.com:kimrejstrom/dnd-above.git && cd dnd-above && npm ci`
in your terminal of choice.

## Project

A PWA Enabled web app optimized for both desktop and mobile. Automatic background saving for ease of use at the table where you are playing.

## What's included

React and Redux Toolkit using Typescript is at the core of this starter kit (see Technologies section for details). The starter-kit is bootstrapped using Create-React-App, and has not been ejected. As the project uses Typescript, ESLint and Prettier have been configured to handle linting and autofixing syntax problems. The project comes bundled with a simple Github workflow for Continuous Integration and default Github Issues and Pull Request templates.

It is out-of-the-box compatible with deployments to static hosting providers such as Netlify and Zeit.
